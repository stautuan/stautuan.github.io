## About
I'm Stacy, a programmer, who enjoys building digital services using Python. From the moment I learned how to build applications with Python, I fell in love. At last, programming became fun! Its simplicity and versatility aligns perfectly with everything that I am and want to create. That's why I built this platform. I want to share with the world everything that tickles my curiosity. Maybe you can learn from my experiences, too -- the mistakes and everything in between. While I enjoy the aspect of being a beginner, I am also committed to mastering the craft. My mission is to leverage my skills and knowledge to continually push boundaries of what technology can achieve.

> I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to "the land of mist and snow;" but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be alarmed for my safety. - **Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein***

 When I am not plotting to take over the world, you'll likely find me immersed in the world of a captivating novel, whether in the drawing rooms of 19th century Victorian England or the desolate plains of a distant realm.
